This is R script an updated version of:

http://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~mkeller/R-progs/yahoo_opt.R

by Martin Keller-Ressel

The author is no longer actively maintaining the code. And the script does not support the current Yahoo! Finance website anymore. 

I rewrote the html parsing part to allow it work properly with the current(2012-March) Yahoo! Finance.
